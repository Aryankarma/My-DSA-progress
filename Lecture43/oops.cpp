// Polymorphism - Polymorphism is a imp concept that allows us to perform a single action in different ways (poly - many, morphs - forms)
// Types of polymorphism - Compile time(static polymorphism) & Run time(dynamic polymorphism)

// Compile time polymorphism - 2 ways -> Function overloading and operator overloading

// Function overloading -
// When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name but different parameters, these functions 
// are overloaded. The main advantage of function overloading is that it increases the programâ€™s readability. 
// Functions can be overloaded by using different numbers of arguments or by using different types of arguments.
// function overloading can not be achieved by changing the return types (int, char, void)

    public:
    // functions of same name - check main function to see initialization

    // int printHello(int num1){
    //     cout << "This function won't work" << endl;
    // }
};


// Operator Overloading - Changing the actual working of an operator is operator overloading 
// operators like: + - * / && || () [] / ! etc etc can be overloaded [cannnot be overloaded:   (::) (.) (?:) (.*)] 

// The first argument is the current object, and the second argument is the object that 
// we are adding it to. The this keyword allows us to refer to the current object so that we can access its properties.

// Run time polymorphism - when we have a class inheriting another class having the same function as the other class (same name & parameters) 
// then if called the function in the child class will be executed (function overriding) 

// use case of run function overriding - imagine having a class with 10 methods, now we created a child class with 
// the same methods but need to override(update) 2 methods, then run time polymorphism can be used
